  # ## SSL Support
  # #
  # # To get SSL working, you will need to add the `https` key
  # # to your endpoint configuration:
  # #
  # #     config :{{PROJECT_NAME}}, {{PROJECT_MODULE}}Web.Endpoint,
  # #       https: [
  # #         ...,

  # #         certfile: System.get_env("SOME_APP_SSL_CERT_PATH")
  # #       ]
  # #
  # # The `cipher_suite` is set to `:strong` to support only the
  # # latest and more secure SSL ciphers. This means old browsers
  # # and clients may not be supported. You can set it to
  # # `:compatible` for wider support.
